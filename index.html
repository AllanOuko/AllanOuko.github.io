											<h3><a href="https://github.com/AllanOuko/Tweets_Analysis" target="_blank"><b>Sentiment Analysis</b></a></h3>
										</header>
										<p>Twitter serves as a valuable platform for staying updated on trends and news. To explore the Russian-Ukraine conflict, I utilized the R package (rtweet) to extract real-time data from Twitter. Focusing on the most recent 10,000 tweets, I conducted sentiment analysis by employing 'Russia' and 'Ukraine' as keywords. Data cleaning was performed, followed by unigram sentiment analysis to identify positive and negative words within the collected tweets. Additionally, I analyzed sentiments expressed by President Biden and President Putin, extracting their latest 10,000 tweets and preserving the codes for text manipulation and cleaning.</p>

											<h3><a href="https://github.com/AllanOuko/SQL-Projects" target="_blank"><b>SQL Projects</b></a></h3>
										</header>
										<p>I extensively employed SQL in my previous projects to efficiently manage and manipulate data within relational databases. For example, I utilized SQL in a customer relationship management (CRM) system to design the back-end database schema, defining tables, relationships, and constraints. SQL queries were instrumental in retrieving and updating customer information, tracking sales activities, and generating reports. This approach ensured the seamless handling of large data volumes while maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance. SQL integration enabled complex data retrieval, dynamic report generation, filtering, sorting, and search functionality in a web application. Additionally, SQL facilitated data analysis by extracting and transforming diverse data sources, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. Overall, SQL's versatility and efficiency have been vital in effective data management and delivering robust solutions.</p>
